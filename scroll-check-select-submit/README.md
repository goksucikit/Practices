# Scroll-Check-Select-Submit

## Scroll
### We have a terms & conditions text which we have to scroll the page to read all.

## Check
### Here we created a checkbox which the users have to check if they are accepting the terms & conditions above. They can not proceed as long as the checkbox hasn't been checked.

### I used Intersection Observer API to enable checkbox section.

## Select
### In case the checkbox progress has been completed, the users can select one of the items they have been given.

### onchange event and removeAttribute() method make the options enable here.


## Submit
### After all processes has been completed, the disabled and hidden Submit button appears on the bottom of the page.
