                <p>The Bernese Mountain Dog is an extremely versatile working dog from the farmlands of Switzerland. They were developed to herd cattle, pull carts, and be watchdogs and loyal companions. They're one of four types of Swiss Mountain Dogs, and the only one with long hair.</p>
                <p>The Bernese Mountain Dog comes from the canton of Bern, hence their name. They're a large and sturdy dog breed, with a friendly and calm disposition, and they're also well-suited to conformation, obedience, tracking, herding, and carting competitions.</p>

                <p>The Border Collie dog breed was developed to gather and control sheep in the hilly border country between Scotland and England. They're known for their intense stare, or “eye,” with which they control their flock. They're dogs with unlimited energy, stamina, and working drive, all of which make them a premier herding dog; Border Collies are still used today to herd sheep on farms and ranches around the world.</p>

                <p>The German Shepherd Dog is one of America's most popular dog breeds — for good reasons. They're intelligent and capable working dogs. Their devotion and courage are unmatched. And they're amazingly versatile.</p>
                <p>The breed also goes by the name Alsatian. Despite their purebred status, you may find German Shepherds in shelters and breed specific rescues. So remember to adopt! Don't shop if this is the breed for you.</p>

                <p>Small, compact, and hardy, Beagles are active companions for kids and adults alike. Canines of this dog breed are merry and fun loving, but being hounds, they can also be stubborn and require patient, creative training techniques.</p>
                <p>Their noses guide them through life, and they're never happier than when following an interesting scent. Beagles originally were bred as scenthounds to track small game, mostly rabbits and hare. They're still used for this purpose in many countries today, including the United States. But you'll find plenty of these pups living as companion dogs and loving, furry family members.</p>
